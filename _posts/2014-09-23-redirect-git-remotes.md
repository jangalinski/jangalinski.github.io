No need to fear renaming your github repos, if you do it right, the old location will forward to the new name/location, 
as documented in [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/how-to-transfer-a-repository#redirects-and-git-remotes).

> When a repository is transferred, all links to the previous location are automatically redirected to the new location.
> In addition to redirecting web traffic, all git clone, git fetch, or git push operations targeting the previous 
> location will continue to function as if made on the new location. However, this can be somewhat confusing, so we 
> strongly recommend updating any existing local clones to point to the new repository URL.
