After upgrading to Mac OSX 10.10 I found some smart tricks to tune the system that I log here.

* [get rid of the dashboard](http://www.cultofmac.com/235806/get-rid-of-the-dashboard-in-mavericks-os-x-tips/) - who needs it anyway?
    * defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean true && killall Dock
* [fix privacy](https://fix-macosx.com/) - make safari and spotlight keep quiet about your search terms
* [phone home (DE)](http://www.aptgetupdate.de/2014/10/21/yosemite-nach-hause-telefonieren/)

## Installation from bootable USB

* [can not verify installation file](http://www.apfelkern.info/probleme-bei-mac-os-x-yosemite-installation-kann-nicht-verifiziert-werden/) - this one is really annoying ...
