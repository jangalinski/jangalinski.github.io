## Who am I

* [jangalinski@github](https://github.com/jangalinski)

* I am fairly active on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/290425/jan-galinski).

## Technology used for this blog

After many (unsuccesful) tries to come up with a regular tech/java based blog (I used wordpress, dokuwiki/blog, blogspot, ...) I finally ended up to have a jekyll/github setup. I can just write simple markdown files and push them to my repo and I am done. Works for me. There is still a lot of work to do (see my [issues](https://github.com/jangalinski/jangalinski.github.io/issues/), and provide new ones if you find something that bothers you).
